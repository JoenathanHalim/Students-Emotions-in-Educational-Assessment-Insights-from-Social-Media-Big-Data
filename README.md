# Students’ Emotions in Educational Assessment: Insights from Social Media Big Data

## Abstract
The intersection between assessment and student emotions remains underexamined, despite increasing scholarly attention to emotional experiences in education. Existing literature has primarily focused on singular emotions, such as anxiety, in relation to assessment (Zeidner, 1998, 2014), leaving a gap in understanding the broader emotional landscape students navigate during assessment events (Chen & Brown, 2018; Fang et al., 2023; Wass et al., 2020). This study addresses that gap by empirically examining students' emotional expressions concerning assessment through large-scale data drawn from social media.

Grounded in control-value theory (Pekrun & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014), the study conceptualizes achievement emotions as outcomes of students' perceived control over assessment tasks, the value they attribute to these tasks, and the contextual conditions surrounding the assessments. Drawing on the taxonomy of achievement emotions (Pekrun et al., 2023; Vogl & Pekrun, 2016), the study investigates how a range of emotions including joy, hope, pride, relief, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, boredom, relaxation, and disappointment co-occur and interact in students' discourse about assessments.

This study utilizes 17,883 Reddit posts from the "r/SGExams" subreddit, a student-led community in Singapore. Posts were filtered based on assessment-related keywords and labeled using 11 emotion categories derived from validated instruments for measuring achievement emotions (Bieleke et al., 2021; Pekrun et al., 2005, 2011). About 7,237 posts (40%) were found to contain emotionally salient content. Quantitatively, emotion co-occurrences were analyzed using partial correlations and visualized through network analysis employing the bootnet package (Epskamp et al., 2018). Subsequently, qualitative readings of selected posts contextualized the co-occurrence patterns and enriched the interpretation of emotional interrelations.

Findings reveal anxiety as the most prevalent emotion, followed by hope, joy, and hopelessness. Negative emotions such as anxiety, shame, anger, hopelessness, disappointment, and boredom form a cluster, indicating co-occurrence of these emotions once students receive or expect less than desirable assessment result (possibly across a history of assessment results). Positive emotions -hope, pride, enjoyment, and relief- also co-occurred, especially in contexts where students articulated confidence or satisfaction with performance outcomes. Notably, hope emerged as a critical emotional buffer, mitigating the intensity of negative emotions when students felt supported in addressing learning gaps.

The study also uncovered that relaxation, though typically associated with post-assessment deactivation, sometimes served as an emotional regulator during assessments to undermine anxiety and refocus student on the assessment task. Boredom, when co-occurring with anxiety, appeared to counteract relaxation's buffering role. These nuanced patterns emphasize the need to consider both the simultaneity and interactivity of emotions in educational assessment contexts.

By combining large-scale social media data with an emotion labeling framework and interpretive qualitative analysis, this study contributes methodologically and substantively to the literature on assessment and emotion. It provides novel insights into the emotional ecology of assessment and highlights actionable directions for educators. The findings suggest instructional spaces, where teachers can use concrete strategies (e.g., relaxation techniques such as breathing) to support student emotional regulation in assessment contexts.
